# Java-program

###Here is the challenge. Either:

- Take a list of integers on standard input, one per line, and return them in reverse order on standard output, or;
- Take a string on standard input and return the string reversed on standard output.

###Conditions:

- You must do this in a language that you have not programmed in before.
- You must not use a library that provides a reverse method or function.
